            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p>This is a quick web page I made to try and help recap and let others practice their JavaScript skills. This is only going to cover up till: '2025-02-16'  however this will likely be updated (if asked lol)  <strong>NOTE: Please take all my code and instructions with a grain of salt, as it may differ from how your used to or is taught.</strong></p>

                    <h3>How it will go. </h3>
                    <p>There will be a JavaScript file for each page, labeled acordingly with the page number on the page itself, simply follow along with the comments describing what to do as its a literal walkthrough on what to do :3</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How to get started?</h3>
                    <p>To get started and continue, you'll simply click the "Next" button down below, if you want to go to a previous page, a previous button will appear (just not here cause its the beginning lol)</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>How will you check that I'm right?</h3>
                    <p>long story short. I can't. Not with my current knowledge on how JS works, although I could with a python script or other language... <span class="italy">I'm Lazy.</span> So we will just work off the trust system here :P</p>
