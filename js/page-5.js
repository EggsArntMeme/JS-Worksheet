/*
only a basic walkthrough of what I am expecting, 
get user input from the form after they submit (all id's are the same as page 3)

check if the value is green, if it is, dont do nothing, otherwise
add the string below to the inner html of the unordered list (with the id="colour-list")

`<li>${ THE USERS INPUT HERE }</li>`

[make sure the previous entrys are still there, and the new ones are  **added** on] [totally not a hint i have no idea what your saying]

// is this copying what we did in the labs and the assignment?     ...n- no,, shut up ;-;
