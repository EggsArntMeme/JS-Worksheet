                <h3>What are Arrays (or lists)?</h3>
                <p>Quick preface that I will likely call Arrays as lists, just what im more used too. ANYWAYS. Lists are a type of variable that holds multiple values, sorted by an index! to create a list, you simply save a variable with  apair of square brackets ( '[]'  <- these) These values are seperated by a comma, just like your <span class="italy">listing</span> objects.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What can Arrays hold?</h3>
                <p>As said before, lists can hold <span class="italy">literally all values</span> so it can hold: integers, floats, strings, booleans, variables, and even other arrays! having a list that contains multiple lists is often refered to as a '2D list' however that is more complex than we'll cover for now.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>How do I select stuff from lists?</h3>
                <p>to pick out specific values from lists, we often use the <span class="italy">index</span> (ooooo). The lists index starts at 0, then increase by 1! To select specific values, you add the index within square brackets simply like: listVariable[0]    (:O gasp)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What are For loops?</h3>
                <p>For loops are a type of loop that goes through the code within it until specified condition is met (for loops are also iterative in nature, going through values one by one through a list). So far, we haven't gone too far into For loops, but we have went through an adjacent form of for loops which are...</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>What is forEach()</h3>
                <p>For each is a method that is applied on a list variable, that'll run a function on each value of the list. This is the main focus for this page, and it is organized down below</p>
